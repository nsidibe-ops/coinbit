It's the largest source of wealth, yet it is illiquid for 99% of the world today. In the past, you only had access to real estate if you were rich or had rich friendsâ€“meaning that most people weren't able to benefit from the passive income and capital appreciation it provides. 
                    Today, coinbit cuts out the expensive middle man and provides access for investors, by investing in shares of real estate using crypto currencies.</p>
